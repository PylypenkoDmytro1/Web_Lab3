                    <hr>
                    <p>The world of Fear & Hunger does not have one unified religion. Instead, there are several extremely powerful deities known as the Old Gods, who are separately worshipped by different factions in the game's world. They are seen as the true gods of the world, embodying the fundamental and primordial ideas, inspirations, or concepts that exist within it. Information about them can be gathered from specific documents regarding their nature found in the two games currently released. While not all of them have been revealed, ten different runic symbols have been portrayed so far, which could be an indication of their numbers. Despite the revelation of only six (or five, depending on which interpretation of Alll-mer is used) deities, ten distinct runic symbols linked to the Old Gods have been depicted. This portrayal could be an indication of their total numbers, although it is equally plausible that these symbols only represent the Old Gods that this world's civilization knows of.</p>
                    <p>The series suggests that the origins of some, if not all, of the Old Gods trace back to the mysterious "green hue." This hue is believed to radiate from a void, serving as the plane of these older deities. Described as a realm where reality adopts a green-tinted appearance, the green hue causes discomfort to human eyes. There are instances where servants of these Old Gods also emerge from this green hue, akin to emerging from a sea, hinting at its potential as a portal between different planes of existence. Further revelations regarding this green hue are yet to unfold within the series.</p>
                    <p>Available lore in both games seems to indicate that some of these older deities have 'departed' from the world, but their traces are very strong remaining energies that are somehow still sentient and influential. Some accounts state that Old Gods never truly fade away, for one cannot extinguish an idea, an inspiration, or a primordial concept once it has taken form. However, not everyone within the game's universe shares a unanimous belief in this perspective.</p>
